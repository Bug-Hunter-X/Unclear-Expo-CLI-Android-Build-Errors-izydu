The solution often involves manual inspection of the `android/` directory and its Gradle files (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`). Carefully review error messages and relevant lines in Gradle files for inconsistencies or errors in dependencies, or even potential conflicts in native modules.  You might need to clean the build and rebuild.  Common fixes include:

- **Manually resolving dependency conflicts:** Examine Gradle files for version conflicts.  Ensure all dependencies have compatible versions.
- **Cleaning the build:** Run `./gradlew clean` to remove the build cache, which may contain outdated or corrupted files.
- **Checking for native module issues:** If you're using native modules, verify that they are correctly configured and linked.
- **Inspecting Gradle sync issues:** Check if Android studio Gradle sync provides more detail. You might need to update your gradle versions and related android tools in your `android/` directory.
