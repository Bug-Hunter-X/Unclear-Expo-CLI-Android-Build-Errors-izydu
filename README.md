# Unclear Expo CLI Android Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when building an Android application using the Expo CLI. The build process unexpectedly fails with vague error messages, hindering debugging and resolution.

## Bug Description

The Expo CLI's Android build process terminates with error messages that lack sufficient detail to identify the root cause.  These errors can stem from dependency conflicts, incorrect configurations in the Android project's `build.gradle` files, or issues related to native modules.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `android` directory.
3. Attempt to build the Android project using the Expo CLI (e.g., `expo prebuild`).
4. Observe the unclear error messages.

## Solution

The solution involves meticulous examination of the error messages (although often vague) combined with checking the `android` folder for any configuration inconsistencies.  This might involve resolving dependency conflicts, ensuring proper configurations in `build.gradle` files, or investigating issues related to the integration of native modules.
